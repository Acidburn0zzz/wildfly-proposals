elytron authentication.

=== Affected Projects or Components

CLI

=== Other Interested Projects

elytron

== Requirements

* Offer simple actions to enable/disable HTTP and SASL authentication for both 
Http server and management interfaces.
* Hide complexity of elytron management model as much as possible without introducing 
unwanted simplification.
* Take benefit of existing Out Of The Box elytron configuration.
* Drive users to select the right set of options thanks to CLI completion that 
controls visibility of options.
* Help users discover the underlying elytron model thanks to the echo-dmr command 
to print out the set of sent model operations.
* Allow user to visualise the management or application authentication configuration.

=== Hard Requirements

* For SASL supported mechanisms are EXTERNAL, DIGEST-MD5. PLAIN, JBOSS-LOCAL-USER, SCRAM-\*, DIGEST-SHA-*
* For HTTP supported mechanisms are CLIENT-CERT, BASIC, DIGEST and FORM

==== Configure SASL Authentication for management interfaces
 
==== enable-sasl-management
Associate an elytron SASL factory to the management interface. In case a SASL factory already exists,
 the factory is extended (or updated) with the selected mechanism. 
If no mechanism is provided, the out of the box SASL factory is associated to the management interface. 
This command creates all the non existing resources required to configure authentication. 
This command can be called multiple times to configure the referenced SASL factory.
 
   
_security enable-sasl-management ( [--file-system-realm=<a string>]
                                    [--user-role-decoder=<a string>] |
                                    [--user-properties-file=<null>]
                                    [--group-properties-file=<null>]
                                    [--relative-to=<a string>] )
                                    [--mechanism=<a string>]
                                    [--exposed-realm-name=<a string>]
                                    [--external-trust-store=<a string>]
                                    [--management-interface=<a string>]
                                    [--new-auth-factory-name=<a string>]
                                    [--new-realm-name=<a string>]
                                    [--new-security-domain-name=<a string>]
                                    [--no-reload] [--super-user]_
 
 
The mininal command to associate the out of the box elytron SASL factory to the HTTP interface +
_security enable-sasl-management_
 
The mininal command to enable EXTERNAL: +
_security enable-sasl-management --mechanism=EXTERNAL --external-trust-store=my-trusted-users-key-store-name_
 
By default, if no _--management-interface_ is provided, we default to http-interface. 
Command would force the server to reload except if _--no-reload_ is set.

==== Options

===== Mechanisms:

--mechanism: The mechanism to enable. CLI completer exposes all supported SASL mechanisms.

===== Truststore realm:

--external-trust-store=Must be specified when the mechanisms is EXTERNAL, 
this is the name of the trust-store. Completion propose the existing key-stores.

===== Filesystem realm (enabled when the mechanism requires this configuration):

--file-system-realm=The filesystem-realm name. +
--user-role-decoder=Only if --file-system-realm is in use. The name of the role 
decoder to extract the roles from the users repository. +
--exposed-realm-name=The realm-name exposed to the user.

===== Properties file realm (enabled when the mechanism requires this configuration):

--users-properties-file=A path to the properties file. +
--groups-properties-file=A path to the properties file. +
--exposed-realm-name=The realm-name located in users properties file and exposed 
to the user. must be set for this realm. +
--relative-to=Server property to make properties file relative.

===== Local user properties:

--super-user: In order to configure local user with super-user permissions.

===== Names for generated resources:

--new-auth-factory-name=To name the factory with the specified name, by default computed based on the mechanism name. +
--new-security-domain=To name the security domain with the specified name, by default computed based on the realm name. +
--new-realm-name=To name the realm with the specified name, by default computed based on the realm realm name.

===== Management interface

--management-interface=The management interface to configure, by default is http-interface+http-upgrade

===== Server directives

--no-reload=By default server is reloaded, use this option to not reload the server.

==== disable-sasl-management
 
This command removes the active SASL factory or a mechanism from the active SASL factory.  
Without any mechanism provided, this command erases the factory from the http-upgrade or native interface. 
NB: Existing resources are not removed from management model. +
 
_security disable-sasl-management [--management-interface=<a string>]
                                     [--mechanism=<a string>] [--no-reload]_
 
==== reorder-sasl-management
 
Re-order the SASL mechanisms. The --mechanisms-order option is a comma separated 
list of mechanisms names. CLI completion proposes the mechanisms present in the targeted factory. 
By default http-interface is used. +
 
_security reorder-sasl-management --mechanisms-order=<a string>
                                     [--management-interface=<a string>]
                                     [--no-reload]_
 
==== Enabling/Disabling HTTP Authentication for http management interface
 
==== enable-http-auth-management

This command targets only the management http-interface. Similar behaviour than enable-sasl-management command. +
 
_security enable-http-auth-management ( [--file-system-realm=<a string>]
                                         [--user-role-decoder=<a string>] |

                                         string>] [--no-reload]_
 
The mininal command to associate the out of the box elytron HTTP factory to the HTTP interface: +
_security enable-http-auth-management_
 
==== Options

Same options than _enable-sasl-management_. The completer for _--mechanism_ exposes HTTP mechanisms.
 
==== disable-http-auth-management
 
This command removes the active HTTP factory or a mechanism from the active HTTP factory. 
Without any mechanism provided, this command erases the factory from the interface. 
NB: Existing resources are not removed from management model. +
 
_security disable-http-auth-management [--mechanism=<a string>]
                                          [--no-reload]_

==== Enabling/Disabling HTTP Authentication for undertow security domain
 
==== enable-http-auth-http-server

Associate an elytron HTTP factory to the security domain. In case a SASL factory already exists, 
the factory is extended(or updated) with the selected mechanism. 
If no mechanism is provided, the Out of The Box Application HTTP factory is 
associated to the security domain. This command creates all the non existing 
resources required to configure authentication. This command can be called multiple 
times to configure the referenced HTTP factory. Similar behaviour than _enable-http-auth-management_ command. +
 
_security enable-http-auth-http-server --security-domain=<a string> (
                                          [--file-system-realm=<a string>]
                                          [--user-role-decoder=<a string>] |
                                          [--user-properties-file=<null>]
                                          [--group-properties-file=<null>]
                                          [--relative-to=<a string>] )
                                          [--mechanism=<a string>]

                                          string>] [--no-reload]_
 
 
The mininal command to associate the out of the box elytron HTTP factory to the Foo security-domain: +
_security enable-http-auth-http-server --security-domain=Foo_
 
==== Options

--security-domain=Mandatory, the undertow security domain. +
Other options are the same than enable-sasl-management. The completer for _--mechanism_ exposes HTTP mechanisms.
 
==== disable-http-auth-http-server
 
This command removes the security domain or a mechanism from the active HTTP factory. 
Without a mechanism, the security domain is removed. 
NB: Elytron existing resources are not removed from management model. +
 
_security disable-http-auth-http-server --security-domain=<a string>
                                           [--mechanism=<a string>]
                                           [--no-reload]_
=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

No support for mechanisms not listed in Hard Requirements. +
Domain mode is out of scope for this version of this feature but may be considered in the future.
