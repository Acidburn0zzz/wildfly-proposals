== Overview

Currently, RESTEasy 3.x (targeted to Wildfly) uses servlet context-params to obtain
configuration information. In RESTEasy 4.x, we have updated configuration to access
all standard MicroProfile Config sources. Also, we have added three additional ConfigSources:

* servlet init-params [ordinal 60]
* filter init-params [ordinal 50]
* servlet context-params [ordinal 40]

All parameters, both RESTEasy parameters and application parameters, are
available from all ConfigSources to both RESTEasy and application code.

Since this feature will depend on the MicroProfile Config project, it will be 
included in Wildfly by way of the MicroProfile Extension Pack.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* Update RESTEasy to retrieve all configuration parameters from MicroProfile ConfigSources.
* Add to RESTEasy a new module, resteasy-microprofile-config, with three ConfigSources for
  servlet context-params, servlet init-params, and filter init-params.
* Configure Wildfly with an optional dependency on resteasy-microprofile-config.

== Test Plan

Tests already exist in the RESTEasy codebase for RESTEasy 4.x These can be ported to 
RESTEasy 3.x.

== Community Documentation

The RESTEasy 4.x user guide discusses the use of MicroProfile in JAX-RS applications. That
material can be re-used.
