== Overview


MicroProfile 3.1 provided a minor upgrade for MicroProfile Metrics 2.1. However this version introduced a regression and a 2.2 version was released shortly after to fix this regression.
This component upgrade will integrate https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/releases/tag/2.2[MicroProfile Metrics 2.2].
This component upgrade also covers the upgrade of smallrye-metrics 2.3.0 that implements MicroProfile Metrics 2.2.0
